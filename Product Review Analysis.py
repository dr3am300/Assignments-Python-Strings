# Task 1: Keyword Highlighter
# Write a program that searches through reviews list and looks for keywords such as "good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", and "average". 
# We want you to capitalize those keywords then print out each review. 
# Print out each review with the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.
    # reviews = [
       # "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
       # "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
       # "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
       # "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
       # "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."
# So for the first string in the reviews list, we want it to say: "This product is really GOOD. I'm impressed with its quality."
